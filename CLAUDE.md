# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Cigarrynos web landing page - a static website showcasing the Cigarrynos mobile app for cigar enthusiasts. The landing page includes multi-language support (EN/FR), age verification, and links to download the mobile apps.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local development server (uses serve package)
npx serve

# The site uses static HTML/CSS/JS - no build process required
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Language Support**: Always update both `en.json` and `fr.json` when adding new translatable content
2. **Legal Documents**: Legal content is stored as Markdown files and rendered dynamically
3. **Age Verification**: Required before accessing main content, persists in localStorage
4. **Static Hosting**: Designed for GitHub Pages deployment (CNAME file present)
5. **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS/JS - changes are immediately reflected
